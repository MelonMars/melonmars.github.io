<h1>Boyd</h1>
<p>This book is the biography of Colonel John Boyd in the USAF. It details how he goes from a hardworking lifeguard in Erie to highly responsible for the design of modern fighter planes, such as the F-15</p>
<p>Throughout his career in the air force, he becomes an instructor at the USAF Fighter Weapons School, the precursor to Top Gun from the Navy. He takes charge of a base in Vietnam.</p>
<p>But above all, the thing he is most successful with, is his theory about how aircraft actually work, with his main reason for their working being their maneuverability. He creates equations for this, shows graphs to high ranking generals, and helps design planes about it.</p>
<p>From his work in the energy maneuverability theory, he comes up with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop">OODA loop</a>, Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. The person who comes out on top can do this the fastest.</p>
<p>It's a fascinating book, and some of the best successes I know that he did are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>At Fighter Weapons School, he offered money to whoever lasted more than 10-60 seconds (I don't remember). He never paid out.</li>
    <li>He came up with Energy Maneuverability Theory, changing the whole way the Pentagon was making their planes. He saved numerous airmen lives from fighting for better craft. And he <i>never</i> took contractors' bs (something the Pentagon now could try doing more of)</li>
    <li>Came up with the OODA loop</li>
    <li>Helped the Marines with massive exercises, that got them ready for combat, especially in terms of combat. He got them out of the strategic rut they had been in since WW2 (i.e. show them they're not just island hopping anymore, and there's more than just the beachhead).</li>
    <li>Mastermind the outstanding Coalition victory in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War">gulf war</a>.</li>
</ul>
