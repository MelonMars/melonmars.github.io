<h1>Slopper</h1>
<p>Slopper is an algorithmic slop generator, that produces fake brainrot.</p>
<p>It does this by using Microsoft/phi-2 to create a short script, with background images in brackets [Like this]. These background images are then fed into stable diffusion with 5 steps, producing very unrealistic outputs. The script is then broken into one word chunks, corresponding to the background image appearing before it. These are then overlaid using Python Pillow over the background images, producing new images, before being compressed into one mp4. Then, a text to speech library runs over the text, speaking it all out, outputting it to an mp3. Then, a below video, like one of those minecraft parkour ones, is overlaid on the bottom of the original mp4, which is squished, and is then formatted to mobile viewing. Finally, the audio is overlaid on the text, producing brainrot.</p>
<p>It was pretty fun to make if I do say so myself!</p>
