<h1>GeminiBB</h1>
<p>GeminiBB was a bulletin board system I made for the <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/">Gemini Protocol</a>. Honestly, I don't really remember how any of it works. I might come
 back to it later, but I'm done with Gemini (it really wasn't interesting, and there isn't an RSS reader for it), so I don't really care about it too much.</p>
