<h1>Mighty Eighth</h1>
<p>The Mighty Eighth was the USAAF Air Force in England, who bombed Nazi occupied Europe. While the British did a lot of nighttime area bombing, the 8th mainly just did daylight bombing, for extra precision.</p>
<p>At the start of the US involvement, and until 1944, they were woefully outnumbered, without long range fighters, and they suffered horrendous losses. It was statistically impossible for someone to complete their full tour of duty (but there were so many people that some, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Belle_(aircraft)">Memphis Belle</a>, did do the impossible)</p>
<p>By 1944 however, they had gotten air superiority all over Europe, due to the P-51. This allowed them to fly all over, with no real problems, and it ended up heavily impacting German production and morale, and was a key factor in the winning of the Allies in WW2.</p>
<p>All in all, this book was extremely good, and went through the nitty gritty, similar to Band of Brothers, and highly suggest you read them both.</p>
