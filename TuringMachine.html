<h1>Turing Machine</h1>
<p>Oh boy. This Turing Machine is still not too close to done, but I've been working on it forever it feels like (since January 2024).</p>
<p>I keep on having to go through design change after design change due to things not working, and 3D printing taking forever, but I think I'm actually getting close to finished.</p>
<p>The current design I have functions by having a reader, that is a little box that is moved up by sliding against a data bit. That causes the release of a metal ball bearing/marble.</p>
<p>This marble then goes down into a sorter apparatus, keeping a state, before exiting in an output shaft. Once in an output shaft, it shorts wires for motors to cause the machine to both move itself, move the states, and move the data bit.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on making the sorter apparatus, which is going to have to be very elevated, due to the planetary gearbox I am using being massive (like 8in Dia).</p>
