<h1>Band of brothers</h1>
<p>This book was... it was something.</p>
<p>It has you following Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division all the way from their training at Currahee, where they were lead by Lt. (and later Capt.) Sobel, who forced them to run 6 miles a day, and pushed them beyond their limits.</p>
<p>You follow as they go to England to finish up preparations, before being dropped the night before D-Day, to secure roads for the allied advance. They then get deployed in the ill-fated Operation Market Garden, and then in the Battle of Bastogne, through towards the end of the war.</p>
<p>There is no one main character in the book, but if anyone had to be, it would 2nd Lt. Winters, who finishes the war as a major. He led them from D-Day (Sobel was transferred to a logistics position before D-Day, and their replacement for Sobel was shot down in his C-47 before jumping on Normandy).</p>
<p>The book is a deeply personal book, that in a way transports you there (of course nothing can substitute for what it actually felt like). The author, Stephen Ambrose, is highly skilled, and the book is ineffable.</p>
<p>Of all the books I have here, I think this is the one that people should read the most. It is outstanding.</p>
