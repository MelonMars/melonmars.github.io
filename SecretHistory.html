<h1>Secret History of the World</h1>
<p>So, I would just like to start off by saying that, even though I am writing about this book, it doesn't mean I necessarily agree with everything the book says.</p>
<p>So, that said, this book poses a separate view of reality, one believed by supposed "secret societies". In it, all of the world is a reflection essentially of God upon himself, a story in his head. The story of the world is the world slowly forming consciousness. We go from no matter, to matter. To matter being changed by living beings, by humans. To consciousness slowly arriving, and being perfected, with more and more things being added on. The book posits that consciousness, as a reflection of God, has basically magical powers, if used correctly. It also says this is a cycle. From no consciousness to consciousness and back. And that this cycle is plagued by people fighting against it, by Satan and Lucifer. It says that we have recently reached the precipice, that being around the mid 1800s. But now we are slipping back, and then it makes a prediction down to the year of when it will happen, I think in 10000AD, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>This book was... weird. I think it was cool though, and a really fun read. I don't fully understand it, and definitely plan on re-reading it one day. And I would suggest it to anybody, due to this coolness.</p>
