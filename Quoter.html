<h1>Quoter</h1>
<p>This is a bot that creates fake quotes from a webui.</p>
<p>It has a high temperature setting, so a high randomness, and then it will create a random quote in the format: "[Background Image] Quote"</p>
<p>Then, the [Background Image] is removed, and is replaced by a stable diffusion created background image, while the Quoter has a "- NAME" appended to it, based on a randomly selected name.</p>
<p>The quote is then added on top of the Background Image using Python Pillow.</p>
<p>I would say it is responsible for a lot of funny fake, misattributed quotes.</p>
