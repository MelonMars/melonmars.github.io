<h1>Blot</h1>
<p>This is some algorithmic art I made for a Hackclub challenge.</p>
<p>It is essentially a fully customizeable neon city, with cars, streets, and skyscrapers. The code is well commented (at least for the variables), so I don't really feel a need to explain it here.</p>
<p>It is based off of the magnificent shader art of <a href="https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-cream-of-the-crop/blob/master/Geometric/City/martin%20-%20city%20lights.milk">city lights by martin</a></p>
