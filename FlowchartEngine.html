<h1>Flowchart Engine</h1>
<p>Flowchart engine is a basic game engine, built using Tkinter, that allows the user to create textual video games. It functions by starting off with an initial node, and then branching out from their, with nodes being conditional on the output from the prior node. It then allows the saving of program from the flowchart maker into a .json, which can then be run with the package, to allow for the playing of the generated game.</p>
