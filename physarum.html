<h1>Physarum Polycephalum</h1>
<p>I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this project. I personally really love agent based models, and this was the first one I ever made. This was the first thing I coded after learning algebra. I remember trying to figure out how to get things to work from the paper it was based off of, and nothing was working. I've probably spent the most time (or second most depending on how much I've put into MelonBot) on this project. I remember spending ages walking through the park with my Dad, talking to him about how to get this and that to work. I've got at least 15 graphs of how things should look, how mine differs, and how to adjust it. I would ask my 7th grade math teacher how to get stuff to work. And then I remember finishing it, seeing an amazing result, and getting up out of my chair, grabbing my Dad, and pulling him up to my computer to look at the final version. This is by far my favourite project of all time. </p>
<p>Anyway, this simulates a slime mold forming, and stochastically searching for, and then globbing onto, sugar. It is based off of the paper "Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks" by Jeff Jones. The output of the program is just beautiful.</p>
<p>Looking at the repo, ONLY LOOK AT <code>main2.py</code>. NOTHING ELSE WORKS, AND IDK WHY.</p>
