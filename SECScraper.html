<h1>SEC Scraper</h1>
<p>In the US, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), puts almost all publicly available filings onto their EDGAR database. This includes form 13F, which organizations or people with over $100 Million worth of assets must file, listing what assets they have.</p>
<p>The database is set up in a very easily scraped way. This allowed me to write a scraper, and then graph it all as a network graph, and compute the properties of the stock market.</p>
<p>The result for 2008 is:</p>

<p>The functions should be relatively straight forward if you would wish to scrape the SEC yourself. Just know that the graph takes a LOT of processing power to make (I think it took me around 6 hours of high CPU usage).</p>
