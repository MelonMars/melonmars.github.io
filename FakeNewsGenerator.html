<h1>Fake News Generator</h1>
<p>This is a fake news generator, that makes up headlines and text, fully autonomously, based off of what it scrapes from other news sites.</p>
<p>This was created in the summer of 2023, and was before I had heard of any other fake news generators, making this possibly one of the first ones.</p>
<p>It is only usable via the terminal, and is designed to work with the Wizard LLM, I believe specifically Wizard Vicuna 7B, but I could be wrong (It's been a year).</p>
