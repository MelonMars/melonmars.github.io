<h1>North And South</h1>
<p>This book was... interesting. I thought it was kind of weird, to say the least. It basically seemed to me like someone from Southern England trying to make Northern England seem all stuck up rude.</p>
<p>At the same time, it did give a good glance into how England actually was around the mid-1800s, even though it did seem a little dishonest, it did seem pretty honest to. And it matches up with other stuff I've read from around that time.</p>
<p>The book, in short, is about a girl from rural Southern England, moving to an industrial town in urban Northern England, and not liking it there, but also falling in love with a factory owner, who she doesn't like. She also makes friends with a sickly young girl dying (apparently due to pollution), while her mom is also dying, and her brother, who was a lieutenant on a boat that had a mutiny, which he led, comes back, under the threat of execution, to see them.</p>
<p>I think the book's outstanding for a more drama sort of book, but I don't really like drama, so I wasn't all that thrilled by it.</p>
