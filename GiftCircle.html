<h1>Gift Circle</h1>
<p>Gift Circle is an app programmed in Dart/Flutter, and only tested on Android because I don't have a Mac or anything. It is like a social media sort of, where you can join gift "circles", and then ask for and send people gifts basically. It is really barebones, no profile pictures and everything. The backend is two Firebase DBs, one for data stored in an array, and the other for authentication. The database for posts and whatnot is unencrypted and unprotected, as there is no real reason for it to be, as I'm personally fine with it being scraped and everything (It is no longer online anyway.</p>
<p>Screenshots and actual code coming soon!</p>
