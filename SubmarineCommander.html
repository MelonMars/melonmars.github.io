<h1>Submarine Commander</h1>
<p>This book is an autobiography by LCDR Paul Schratz about his time in the US Navy captaining submarines. During WW2, being a submariner in the pacific was the most dangerous job anyone could have. The book is really insightful.</p>
<p>He goes through how he decides what to put in the sub, and then how he commands it, how he hunts ships, avoids anti-submarine vessels, and numerous close calls. He also brags about how he has done the longest submerged travel in a diesel-electric submarine, with the impressive time of 21 days using the snorkelers, which he did in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Pickerel_(SS-524)">USS Pickerel</a>, after WW2. He also had one of the most successful volleyball teams for the Pacific Submariners!</p>
<p>I wouldn't call it the best book I've ever read (hence why this is so short and not the best), but it was pretty good.</p>
