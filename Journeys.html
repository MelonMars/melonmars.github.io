<h1>Journeys out of the Body</h1>
<p>I read this one for the same reason I read the Secret History of the World, and I would say this one was pretty similar.</p>
<p>It is basically someone saying that he has gone to the spiritual realm, and it is very similar but yet different to what people say it is. He says that because of this, and accidental agreement with Eastern religions, and some scientific evidence, that it is real. I personally am going to choose not to weigh in on it.</p>
<p>He says that he once was guided by a guy who looked like one of the mystic Yogis. He also claims to have found a place like heaven, where there is only bliss, and he didn't leave on purpose (I don't remember if it was because he felt a tug back, or because he had something happen irl). He also claims he has had premonitions of things that have happened, which seemed to me to be stretching extra far. He also said that people tend to move around in this spiritual world depending on their thoughts, so hell could just be where people who all have bad thoughts end up. He also said there was this part that he described, IIRC, was like piranhas were attacking him, and he struggled to get away, as if it was pulling him.</p>
<p>As far as his evidence goes, for premonitions it was weird, and to me feels like imbuing meaning into nothing, but it lined up pretty closely. Outside of that, the evidence is pretty shocking. Firstly, he once made himself do an out-of-body experience while in a lab, and that the scientists reported he looked hazy. Several times he has been able to see what people are doing, like random stuff that nobody would guess, and he has several times gotten almost everything controlled, which was pretty shocking. He also claims to have pinched someone while being out of body, several miles away, and that when he saw the person later, they had a bruise from his pinch.</p>
<p>He also says, BTW, that theirs another dimension, with a version of him who, once again IIRC, does NOT have his life together.</p>
<p>All in all pretty good book, and would recommend, because it is interesting. And well written, to the point where even if it were just a fiction book, it would be a good fiction book.</p>
